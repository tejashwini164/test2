The basic Git workflow goes something like this:
hi this is newly added.
You modify files in your working tree.
new branch created.
changing somthing here..
editinfg for webhooks

You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds only those changes to the staging area.

You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory
